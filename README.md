# ArduinoTester
This code helps you find what's wrong with your wiring if the code doesn't work or test your project quickly before writing the code.

This is a work in progress.
It is made for all sorts of arduino and prototyping boards but for now it works (and tested) on Arduino UNO, NANO and MEGA.
I am an amateur and wrote this code for my own projects but a friend told me it's a good idea to share it, so here we go.
My suggestion for you is; upload the code to an existing project before reading it through, it should be very intuitive and easy to work with
The code is a bit long and unorganized, sorry for that.

Things that need to be done:
1. Create classes for the Arduino types.
2. Integrate the TestAll function.
3. Add documentation and comments to the functions.
4. Find a better solution to store the arrays.
5. Seperate the functions to X.h files.

Thank you :)
